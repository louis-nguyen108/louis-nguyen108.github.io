    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</h3>
    <p>
      I consider myself to be generous, open-minded, idealistic and passionate. Therefore, in terms my learning, I believe that I will always try my best to figure out things on my own and will never back down against problems or challenges; and then once I solve the problem, I will use that experience to help others. I will also be open to hearing new ideas/suggestions from others and if I believe in the ideas, I am happy to make changes to accommodate and progress the ideas/suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I think that some of my strengths can become my limitations in the way I do things too such as my idealistic mindset as well as other limitations that I have including being unrealistic and very self-critical. I have been trying to balance and improve all of these throughout my life. When something happens or doesn't happen exactly the way I expected it to be, I tend to get emotional and start looking for something/someone to blame (and that something/someone is often me, even if the true cause of it wasn't). This can have a detrimental effect on my learning and my relationships with others. However, throughout the years, I have learned to control this better by either accepting that sometimes things are just the way they are and that as they happened, they cannot be changed anymore so rather than dwelling on the issue, I should rather look on the positive side of things and look for solutions to the problem.
    </p>
    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I think that the ability to <strong><em>not</em></strong> compare myself to others is definitely at the top of my list. Being very self critical yet passionate and competitive (kind of haha), I always compared myself or my work to others and feel demotivated or embarrassed when mine is not as great (at least in my perspective).
    </p>
    <p>
      I also would like to develop the ability to work well in a team environment in the tech industry. I have spoken to a family member - who is a developer - who has described briefly how this works in general but I feel that being able to actually experience this will prepare me better for real work environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, I would love to develop somewhat of an ability to forecast the effort required (especially time) for a project so that I know to stick to my timing and avoid going down a rabbit hole.
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
    <p>
      <em>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I commit to treat others with respect, curiosity and an open-mind. I am here to learn as much as I can and I feel that having no previous background or experience with development is a disadvantage but also an advantage in itself, I feel that I am a vacuum that is always hungry to absorb as much information as possible. I also plan to commit to the specified working schedule designed by Dev Academy and to put in as many hours as needed to complete required project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I will commit to firstly stay calm and not let my stress or frustration get to me. Secondly, I will move away from my deks for a quick break, likely going outside to get some fresh air and clear my head. If this still doesn't help, I will probably talk to someone who is available to listent about what I'm currently facing and hopefully this will help me reset and get back on track, or even better, get un-stuck if possible. 
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      I will commit to start by trying to figure out on my own through online research, followed by seeking help from other learners who are more skilled than me. And if I'm still stuck I will seek guidance from a facilitator within no more than 30 minutes since I started becoming stuck.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I would really appreciate if the facilitation team can be available to help me get un-stuck when I have question.
    </p>
    <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
    <p>
      There aren't many scheduling information that I can think of. I have discussed with my family and we all agreed that I will be committing to the full time study schedule during bootcamp, as well as any additional hours to ensure I meet my delivery target.

    <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
    <span class="date"><em>Updated 15 May 2022</em></span>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <em>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</em>
    <br>
    <br>
    My goal is mostly similar to what I have mentioned earlier. I would say that I place more focus on short term and short-to-medium term goals of finishing Dev Academy program and securing employment due to my personal circumstances.
    <br>
    <br>
    In terms of what I am hoping to use my skills for, I really want to join a good Kiwi game studio such as GGG or Ninja Kiwi and help make awesome games, otherwise joining a company that is making app or software that helps make positive impact in the world. I would love to be able to make a game on my own, however it is too difficult given my current level so I'm looking at joining an organisation and gain more skills and knowledge first.
    <h3> What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      I think that this has not changed much. My strengths and limitations mainly remain the same. However, I have been working on my limitations since starting my course at Dev Academy and will continue to improve so that it will not hinder my growth and development during bootcamp.
    </p>
    <h3> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
      I think that my biggest non-technical challenge would be keeping focused for nine weeks. It's not that I don't enjoy learning programming, it's more I think that the intensity will require significant physical and mental health to stay on top of the workload.
    </p>
    <h3> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      This is similar to before with some additions.
      <br>
      <br>
      Firstly, I would like to develop the ability to work well in a team environment in the tech industry (including pair programming). I have spoken to a family member - who is a developer - who has described briefly how this works in general but I feel that being able to actually experience this will prepare me better for real work environment.
      <br>
      <br>
      Secondly, I would love to develop somewhat of an ability to forecast the effort required (especially time) for a project so that I know to stick to my timing and avoid going down a rabbit hole.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition, I think that I would like to develop the ability to give and receive feedback which I think is one of my weaknessess and something I don't practice as often even though I think it will be instrumental to my growth and development. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I also would like to improve on my self-awareness and reflective skills. This is another area where I feel that I am not as strong as others.
    </p>

      <em>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Same as before, I commit to treat others with respect, curiosity and an open-mind.

    </p>
    <h3>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h3>
    <p>
      Same as before. I will commit to start by trying to figure out on my own through online research, followed by seeking help from other learners who are more skilled than me. And if I'm still stuck I will seek guidance from a facilitator within no more than 30 minutes since I started becoming stuck.
    </p>
    <h3> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>
      This is probably unchanged. I would really appreciate if the facilitation team can be available to help me get un-stuck when I have question by giving me hints and/or giving me feedback so I know if I am going in the right direction but let me figure things out on my own first unless I have been stuck for too long and/or have asked explicitly for hands on assistance.
